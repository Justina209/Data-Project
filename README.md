# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of funding received by Indian startUp. EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process where we investigate the dataset by summarizing its main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and visualization tools. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through visual and quantitative techniques.

In this project, the following key tasks are performed:
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Conducting descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of variables.
- Visualizing relationships and correlations between variables.
- Drawing insights that could inform further analysis, such as machine learning or predictive modeling.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Indian startUp
- **Source**: We merged 4 dataset: 1 from Github, 2 from a database, 1 from a google drive
- **Description**: Our data had columns like company name,what the company does,year startup were founded,investors, funding amount received etc.
- **Objective**: The primary objective of the analysis is to [define the main goal, such as understanding customer purchasing behavior, identifying factors influencing a specific outcome, etc.].
**Size**:the merged dataset had about 2899 rows and 10 columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Data Cleaning
This step involves:

Handling missing values: We will either remove rows/columns with excessive missing data or impute missing values using strategies such as mean, median, or mode imputation.
Data type conversion: Ensure that categorical, numerical, and datetime fields are properly formatted.
Removing duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate rows.
Outlier detection and handling: Use visual and statistical methods to detect and, if necessary, mitigate the influence of outliers.
2. Descriptive Statistics
In this section, we compute key statistical metrics that summarize the data:

Mean, Median, Mode for numerical variables.
Standard deviation, Variance to understand the spread of data.
Count and unique values for categorical features.
Skewness and kurtosis to check data distribution characteristics.
3. Visualizations
Using the cleaned data, we will generate the following visualizations to gain insights:

Univariate Analysis: Histograms, bar plots, and box plots to understand the distribution of individual variables.
Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis: Scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between two or more variables.
Key plots include:

Histograms: To check the distribution of each numeric variable.
Box Plots: To visualize outliers and the spread of data.
Scatter Plots: To examine relationships between two numeric variables.
Bar Charts
4. Correlation Analysis
We will compute the Pearson correlation coefficient to identify linear relationships between numerical features. Features with a high correlation (positive or negative) will be noted for further investigation. Heatmaps and pairplots will be used to visualize these correlations.

Results and Insights
Here we summarize the key findings from the analysis:

Trends: [Identify any key patterns observed, such as increasing/decreasing trends in the data].
Outliers: [Describe significant outliers and their impact on the dataset].
Correlations: [Mention important correlations discovered, e.g., variable X and Y are highly correlated].
Other Findings: [List any additional insights that might be relevant].
Example:

Age appears to have a strong positive correlation with income.
Certain features (e.g., feature A and feature B) show clustering, indicating potential for segmentation.
Conclusions
In this section, we will conclude by summarizing the results and their implications:

Key Findings: [Briefly summarize the main insights derived from the analysis].
Limitations: [Mention any limitations or challenges faced, such as data quality issues or assumptions made].
Future Work: [Suggest next steps, such as predictive modeling or further analysis on specific variables].
For example:

A clear positive relationship between [Variable 1] and [Variable 2] suggests [a possible actionable insight].
The analysis could be extended by applying machine learning techniques like clustering or regression.
